# Lucero Portfolio Website
This is a personal portfolio website where a client asked to display their information in a friendly and approachable way. Information is organized in a readable way avoiding overwhelming text by spreading out images.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Used HTML to display client's content, then CSS to edit a template and JavaScript to collect forms and make buttons responsive.

## Optimizations

Could've made forms to be collected by hosting instead of using a third party service such as Formspree for this, making it more elegant, however Formspree has an ease to send information to personal email. Another thing is reducing the size of the images displayed further so that load times are shorter. 

## Lessons Learned:

Learned about formm collection and hosting services. Domain implementation from a third party using Netlify was confusing at first but rather simple looking back, however the terminology was new so learning about where to plug the nameservers was a challenge. Also familiarized myself with bootsrap terminology. Implemented WhatsApp API to send template message to a static number.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
